\maketitle

The only equipment necessary for my proposed work are an office, something to write on, and a computer. I have a spacious office in Dr Sella's labspace, with access to plenty of paper and a two large whiteboard walls. I also have a 2016 Macbook Pro provided by Dr Sella with all of the software necessary to complete and write up my proposed work (e.g. R, Python, Mathematica, LaTeX, etc.). As described in the Facilities attachement, I also have access to Columbia University's world class computing cluster for when the computer simulations necessary for my project ultimately prove too much for a single laptop.
